* PhD Project 

Here we exchange references, ideas, codes and work in progress.

** DP-next

This project is funded under work package 2 of a grant called DP-next
where 3 PhD students and a post-hoc are employed. Link to githup
repository of work package 2:

** TODO Preparation of a PhD plan

** Highlevel aims

1. To write 3 research papers about statistical methods that are
   clearly motivated by real world problems. 
2. To learn a lot.
3. To keep the spirits up.
   
** Research topics

*** Real world problems

The DP-next WP2 introduction motivates a clear target: new innovative
intervention methods using real time monitoring and the use of
smartphone apps. Evidence based input for these methods should come
from a risk prediction algorithm which is based on electronic medical
records. 

*** Statistical problem

The making of a model that predicts individualized risks requires
careful consideration of the actual application of the model:

- Who is eligible to use the model (target population?)
- When will the model be applied (time zero?)
- Which predictor variables are available through the register data
  and also at the time where the model is applied (variable
  selection?)
- What is the model's intended use?
   + inform a person and guide a personal decision 
   + inform the health authorities about the diabetes risk in the population 
   + inform the planners of an intervention about high risk subgroups of the population
- Temporal updating and regional transportability
