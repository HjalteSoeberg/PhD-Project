* Project 1: Constrained Risk prediction
Problem is that cause-specific risks sometimes sum to more than 1

** Recreating and understanding problem
- Make a small simple dataset where the problem is recreated
- check if problem happens without covariates using aalen-johansen (probably not)
- The problem maybe only happens when we try to extrapolate covariates outside their space. Check if this is the case
- Problem may not happen if we use randomforest for one/both causes because of the last point.


** Solving the problem (only after having recreated it)
- Start simple using only parametetric models (see bender_simulate_cox.pdf for paramettric cox)
- Try using other modeling strategys other than maximum likelihood: constrained maximumlikelihood, using brierscore as lossfunction, maybe some lossfunction with the constraint
- Try joint survival superleaner by munch and Gerds, with some modifications
